# Releases

`VERSION` is the one place the version lives; `tools/embed_version.py` writes it into
`src/support/version.lucb` for `luce-base --version`, and `build.sh` runs that first. A
release is a VERSION bump, a tag `luce-base-N`, and a push, the way luce-seed does it
(`bootstrap/SEED` pins the seed the tree is built against).

## 0.3.0

The target boundary: one IR, generators attached.

- `src/back/frame.lucb`: the frame layout, slot promotion, live ranges, and the linear-scan
  allocator, once, parameterised by the target's callee-saved registers; both generators
  emit byte-identical assembly to what they emitted with their own copies;
- the IR carries no calling convention: an aggregate argument, parameter, or result has
  a *shape*, its scalar leaves, and each generator reads it by its own rule (arm64's
  homogeneous float aggregates, x86_64's SSE eightbytes); `is_float_only`, `float_count`,
  and `sse_words` are gone from the IR and the lowerer;
- the IR names the function the loader runs (`Unit.init_function`); the generators place
  it in `__mod_init_func` or `.init_array`; the lowerer emits no assembler text;
- `src/back/isa.lucb`: the registers inline assembly may name and the scratch registers
  `reg` operands get, per architecture; `sp`, `fp`, and `lr` are integers, not floats;
- `Target` says its linker (`Linker`: Apple's `ld` or the C driver), its system libraries,
  and its architecture's name; the driver reads them instead of the host's `platform`;
- `types.Table.word` from the target's `pointer_bits` sizes pointers, `usize`, texts,
  spans, interface views, and error values;
- `--lib` with `--emit=c` or `--emit=asm` writes the library's code as text for any target;
- a `let` array converts to `const T[]` only (§5.3), as the seed always said and this
  compiler now does too; three rejection tests; `process.run` takes `const c.str[]`;
- `docs/DESIGN.md` describes the boundary; `docs/AUDIT.md` §7 records the pass.

## 0.2.0

The second host: x86_64 Linux, natively.

- `src/back/x86_64.lucb`: an x86_64 code generator over the same IR, System V calls with
  eightbyte classification (`sse_words` on the IR, computed by the lowerer), ELF sections,
  PIE-safe addressing, initial-exec thread-locals, F16C half floats; the compiler builds
  itself natively on Linux and reaches its assembly and C fixpoints there;
- the host is the target the compiler was built for, read from its own `platform` module;
  the driver links through the C driver on Linux; `asm ARCH` arms are taken for the
  target's architecture; `section(".name")` is one spelling for every target (§9.8);
- both C backends compute a call's effectful arguments in order (§7.1); `f64.bits(N)` is a
  hexadecimal float literal; the label attribute form GCC accepts;
- per-target bootstrap snapshots, `bootstrap/luce-base-arm64-macos.c` and
  `bootstrap/luce-base-x86_64-linux.c`, written from any host by `tools/snapshot.sh`;
- `tests/platform`: the target-dependent standard library proved on each host, every
  target emitted from every host; the proving programs run on Linux (the editor over
  Linux's `termios`, the freestanding program through Linux system calls, an `asm x86_64`
  arm in the assembly program); `asm-x86_64` limits in the optimisation suite;
- the standard library's Linux arms, written before, now executed and proved: the futex,
  `dirent`, `addrinfo`, `open` flags, `mmap` flags, `SOL_SOCKET`, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`;
- pinned to luce-seed-0.41, whose own gate is green on Linux.

## 0.1.0

The first versioned tree, arm64-macos. What it holds:

- the self-hosting compiler: lexer, parser, checker, C backend, and the native arm64
  backend through the IR with inlining and the pre-backend passes; the product is built
  with no C in its path and reaches a fixpoint on its own assembly;
- the whole specification covered by the conformance suite: 136 programs run through the
  C backend, the native backend, and the seed's interpreter, and 430 rejections checked by
  both compilers, one chapter directory each with a `combined` program beside the simple
  ones; the robustness and optimisation suites; the proving programs;
- the standard library as Base source under `src/std/`, 19 modules, with `docs/LIBRARY.md`
  generated from it; every target-dependent constant and layout decided by the `platform`
  module the compiler writes for `--target`, pruned at compile time;
- targets: arm64-macos natively; the C for any of the five targets with `--emit=c`; the
  Linux values are written and untested, the Windows arms marked.
